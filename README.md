## How do they charge 
You will charge base on aws service.

- S3 $0.023 per GB
- Glue $0.44 per hours (charge only run crawler)
- Athena $5 per 1TB data scan
- Quicksight $9 per month

Example.
Optimism logs data from genesis block to present (Block number 110144079) have size around 200GB. 
When you query the across all data will charge $1, But if you select only attribute like a "topics,data" your will got charge at $0.5. That's pretty awesome.

## Schema
For data exported into .parquet files using Batching and Near Realtime, the schema is as follows:


Default data format
```
blockNumber: { type: 'INT32' },
blockHash: { type: 'UTF8' },
transactionIndex: { type: 'INT32' },
removed: { type: 'BOOLEAN' },
address: { type: 'UTF8' },
data: { type: 'UTF8' },
topics: { type: 'UTF8', repeated: true },
transactionHash: { type: 'UTF8' },
index: { type: 'INT32' },
partitionByBlock: { type: 'INT32' }
```
